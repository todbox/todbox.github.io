# ... oops.
So it seems that, for whatever reason, you hit a 404.
If you were trying to access the song player or the competitive version, sorry, I didn't add those yet :koocfrown:

<audio id="beep">
   <source src="404.wav" type="audio/wav" />
</audio>

var fileref = document.createElement("script");
			fileref.setAttribute("type", "text/javascript");
			fileref.setAttribute("src", "404.js");
			document.head.appendChild(fileref);
